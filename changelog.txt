-Fixed serialization issues by storing data in compressed .CSVs (called a .heatmap file) instead of using compressed serialized Java Heatmap objects, which was causing horrible serialization issues. The plugin is backwards compatible with the old Heatmap style, but not the unreleased HeatmapNew style (which only I used)

-Implemented primitive hashmap (IntIntHashMap from eclipse-collections) which should drastically reduce memory usage compared to the original HashMap<Point, Integer>
Reasoning as follows:
{{{
Reconsidering for the millionth time the most efficient way to hold heatmap data in memory

Option 1:	HashMap<Point, Integer>
Problems:	Each tile requires a Point object (24 bytes) and an Integer object (16 bytes), plus the usual hashmap overhead (possibly including Entry objects?)

Option 2:	Some sort of bitmap
Problems:	So much wasted space.
	Bitmap size = 2752*1664 * 4 byte int = 18,317,312 bytes (17.46 MB)
	For hashmap: each visited tile size * number of tiles visited = (24+16) * X = 18,317,312 = 40X.
	X = 457933 visited tiles before it becomes the size of the bitmap. That is 10% of the overworld map.
	The number of tiles that I have stepped on in my thoroughly tested heatmap is 81694 (1.8% of overworld map)
	Also, bitmap wouldn't allow for storage of tiles underground (yet to implement)

Option 3:	primitive hashmap by eclipse-collections: IntInthashmap. I estimate it should use only 20% of the memory that the HashMap<Point, Integer> uses
(because IntIntHashMap should use just two 4-byte primitive ints (8  bytes) instead of a 24 byte Point and a 16 byte Integer (40 bytes) for each tile)
}}}


2023-09-18: After some analysis I've discovered that using IntIntHashMap is totally unnecessary. It reduces the hashmap from like 4mb (hardly anything to begin with) to half a megabyte. Also, it appears that my PNG one-chunk-at-a-time reader and writer is working and actually reduces memory by 10x. At least the reading part of it does. I still need to figure out the chunk by chunk writing part.
	Result 2023-09-18: Magically figured out ImageIO TIFF tiling. The west is saved and the plugin can now use as little as 12MB to create world heatmap images (if you're willing to wait a long time, but it's adjustable)

2023-09-18: Made it so that tiles outside of the overworld range are kept track of too (previously, they were not.) They are currently not (and will probably never be) displayed in the local world heatmap image, because the underground areas are thousands of tiles north of the overworld and it would use way too much memory for clients to render the large image without some complicated solution. Also, the image would be too large and mostly empty and just be ugly. I'll save the underground stuff for the global world heatmap, perhaps. Or maybe I'll include a java program that can render the big image offline (i.e, outside of RuneLite) so that it doesn't totally vore the allocated memory

2023-09-18: Put PiecewiseImageReaderWriter functionality into the plugin (aww yee)

2023-09-18: Removed system.out.println()s

2023-09-18: The minimum  tiles stepped on field of HeatmapNew never seems to be updated from 1 at (0, 0)
	Solution: It happens when loading in an already made heatmap because it does setFast() instead of set(), so I made it so it does .set() instead of .setFast() (and got rid of setFast)

2023-09-18: Updated osrs_world_map.png and update the image boundary/offset constants. Q: will stepping into the new area crash the plugins of users using the old style and will the data have been stored so that it can be included in their upcoming HeatmapNew? Answer: Users of the outdated plugin version shouldn't crash, but their steps there won't be stored. Once they use the new version, their steps there will begin to be kept track of

2023-09-18: Fixed heatmap transparency for HeatmapImage

2023-09-18: Made it so that osrs_world_map.png is an online file so that I can update it on the fly when the world map is changed (and for christmas lul)

2023-09-18: Made it so that off-world priffdinas steps are mapped onto priffdinas in the output image, on image write

2023-09-18: Made it so that the write heatmap button is greyed out whilst it's already writing one, and changed the text to "Writing... 10%" etc

2023-09-18: Made progress bar/percentage thing for image writing

2023-09-18: Made an option to change the speed-memory tradeoff

2023-09-18: Made it so you can't spam click the write image button

2023-09-23: Changed structure of .heatmap file (now called .heatmaps). It's a zip folder containing a .CSV file for each heatmap type

2023-09-23: Heatmap types added: 
	-Non-PK Deaths
	-PK deaths
	-All deaths
	-dragon impling catches
	-things said out loud
	-value of dropped loot per where you were standing
	-random event spawns
	-places teleported to
	-places teleported from
	-direct lines of teleportation lul (like a flight map)
	-evil bob sightings
	-weighted melee/range/mage strength/accuracy per kill at location
	-xp gained at each tile
NOTE: Will need to include a warning and an opt-in checkbox for global heatmap data when zee website comes along

2023-09-23: Made it so that heatmap images are always written like mostRecentUserID + "_" + heatmapType.toString() + ".tif"

2023-09-23: Got rid of Write CSV button, since you can access all of the CSVs by just unzipping the .heatmaps file

2023-09-23: Made an entry for each heatmap type in the panel

2023-09-23: Made it so that heatmap sensitivity works again

2023-09-23: Implemented direct lines of teleportation lul (like a flight map)

2023-09-23: Implemented places teleported to

2023-09-23: Implemented places teleported from

2023-09-23: Implemented Deaths (untested)

2023-09-23: Implemented placed spoken at (untested)

2023-09-23: Implement xp gained at each tile

2023-09-23: Made it so that totalValue is a long

2023-09-23: Implemented random event spawns (currently counts all random events and not just ones meant for the local player)

2023-09-23: Implemented value of dropped loot per where you were standing (untested) (note: the program doesn't intuit where the item came from. It just knows that it was dropped at that tile. So if you repeatedly drop and pick up and item, it will be counted each time)

2023-09-24: Made it so the evil bob sighting timer is per-world

2023-09-24: Implemented bob the cat sightings

2023-09-24: Implemented NPC_DEATHS (untested)

2023-09-24: Investigated why TELEPORT_PATHS has so many tiles written and why its CSV takes up so much space on disk
           	Result: might have been because it was tracking teleports to/from the coordinate (1, 1). might've had something to do with logging in. Supposedly fixed by making an isInOverworld() method

2023-09-24: Made it so that the restart heatmap button doesn't rewrite the image

2023-09-26: Fixed how for some reason on windows, a file was being created in F:\Code\Java\RuneLite-World-Heatmap\Backups every single tick. The folder named "backups/[CURRENT TIME]" was being created every tick, when instead, each tick, the program should just check if a heatmap backup file should be created in .runelite/worldheatmap/Backups. I might have created the error only a few minutes before.

2023-09-27: Note to self: On windows at least, it seems backups are being made not exactly when I presume they should be (not on the 800th step per se, when the backup frequency is 200, but some time later?) will have to shrek it out
			Result: Just remembered that it autosaves based on heatmap age, not step count.

2023-09-27: Disabled image autosaving by default, but make it so that the user can enable it if they want to

2023-09-27: Made it so the program ignores unexpected ZipEntries in the .heatmaps file and doesn't crash, but gives a warning

2023-09-27: Fixed "LOOT_VALUE heatmap is null" error

2023-09-27: UNVERIFIED: Made it so that the min/max tile values used to calculate the heatmap colors are calculated only from tiles to be drawn (aka overworld tiles)

2023-10-01: Made it so that LOOT_VALUE works properly, and doesn't count ground items when a chunk has just been loaded or include anything other than loot from an NPC that the player has just killed (turns out there's an Event for that, which doesn't seem to be listed on the runelite API Events page)

2023-10-04: Changed Number of levels for speed-memory tradeoff from 7 to 10

2023-10-05: Before I could implement the entire osrs world map image writing, I made it so osrs_world_map.png uses 4x4 pixel tiles instead of 3x3. A new osrs_world_map.png had to be made (cut out from Explv's world map image)

2023-10-05: Changed the HeatmapImage offsets/gameCoordsToImageCoords to fit the new osrs_world_map.png

2023-10-05: Made sure that processImageRegion can write images with 4x4 px per tile

2023-10-07: Fixed how tiles that fall on the edges of TIFF tiles are not written. I fixed it by making processImageRegion return if a pixel that is currently attempting to be written is outside the image bounds and re-add the pixel to the queue, instead of just skipping the pixel

2023-10-07: Saw what happens if I don't use multiples of 16 for tile height. UPDATE: it works fine

2023-10-10: Enable plugin users to write their own full-map images in-game, which include non-overworld areas

2023-10-12: Make the loading text on the heatmap panel red to make it more noticeable

2023-10-12: Made each heatmap type toggleable. Note: The disabled heatmaps are still loaded into memory or initialized, but they are not incremented.
            NOTE: This was done by keeping the reading and writing of supported heatmaps enabled, but will just make the incrementing of each heatmap type dependent on whether or not it is enabled

2024-03-11:	Made a `config.isHeatmapEnabled(heatmapType)` function instead of having a bunch of different functions

2024-03-11:	Make new method that writes one heatmap type at a time to the .heatmaps ZIP instead of all at once

2024-03-11:	Modify writeHeatmapsFile to use the above function to write all enabled heatmaps (do not perform it on disabled/unloaded ones or they'll be restarted or null pointer exceptions will be thrown)

2024-03-11:	Made it so that during writing, if a heatmap is disabled or not loaded, leave it untouched in the .heatmaps ZIP

2024-03-11:	Made it so that when disabled, a heatmap type is not loaded on startup

2024-03-11:	Added the condition to initializeMissingHeatmaps() that they're not initialized if disabled

2024-03-11:	Changed the readHeatmapsFile method to use FileSystem instead of ZipInputStream

2024-03-11:	Made it so that a heatmap being disabled makes it not show up in the panel

2024-03-11:	Separated readHeatmapFromFile into `readHeatmap(HeatmapType, HeatmapsFile)` and `readHeatmapOld(HeatmapsFile)`

2024-03-11:	Made it so that on enabled, a heatmap type is read from disk and loaded

2024-03-11:	Made it so that on disabled, a heatmap type is saved to disk

2024-03-11:	Made it so that panels don't appear for disabled heatmaps

2024-03-11:	Make it so that when disabled, heatmap types are not incremented

2024-03-11:	tl;dr made it so that disabling heatmaps writes them to disk, and enabling loads them.

2024-03-11:	Implemented memory usage estimation for each beatbap type, based on number of Entry<Point, Integer> objects, Point objects, and pooled/unpooled Integer objects

2024-03-11:	Asked chatGPT if there is a less retarded workaround for the old serialization issue.
	Result: Seems like I screwed myself by previously using ObjectOutputStream to write Heatmap objects without serialVersionUID fields. There's not really a way to deserialize these files to Heatmap objects without having the unmodified Heatmap class in the program, so I'm stuck having Heatmap and HeatmapNew

2024-03-11: See if RuneLite occasionally not wanting to terminate has something to do with the plugin
	Result: it doesn't seem to happen anymore so perhaps it was not related to the plugin

2024-03-11:	Implemented DAMAGE_TAKEN

2024-03-11:	Implemented DAMAGE_GIVEN

2024-03-12:	broke, then fixed writing to .heatmaps for shadowjar (fixed it by closing the OutputStreamWriter which had to be moved out of the old try-with-resources)

2024-03-12:	broke, then fixed how for some reason it couldn't read old .heatmap files because of an InvalidClassException (turns out it was because I had changed the name of a single variable)

2024-03-12:	broke, then fixed how after reading and converting an old heatmap file, the Type A and Type B are not put into the heatmaps Map (it was because I changed 2 lines of code and caused them to be loaded as UNKNOWN types which are not initialized or something)

2024-03-29:	fixed how for some reason heatmap tiles were missing in horizontal stripes in the image, depending on the speed-memory tradeoff, but only for TELEPORT_PATHS?
	note: finally figured out the source of the error, which was that heatmap pixels when being written to the image were not being checked for being out of bounds
	note: actually, it seems that out of boundsness was already being checked for the tile being written, but it was only checking for the upper left corner of the 4x4 coloured pixels being written per game tile, so a game tile whose upper left corner is within the image bounds but not the rest of it was causing le errors le.

2024-03-29:	made it so HeatmapImage gets its offsets from the gtw-runelite-stuff repo

2024-03-29:	Put a total memory usage estimate in the panel

2024-03-29:	fixed how the Player ID was often "unavailable" in the panel

2024-03-30:	tested the update with shadowjar on raptop, seems to be twerking all good

2024-03-30:	Fixed how it was loading the Type A heatmap file instead of Type B when converting old types to new

2024-03-30:	Made it so that writing an image for an empty heatmap doesn't throw an IllegalArgumentException "Heatmap is empty" which was resulting from getting the min/max values of an empty heatmap

2024-03-30:	Added a check for min/max X coordinates when checking if coordinates are in bounds when incrementing heatmaps such as TELEPORT_PATHs to help reduce likelihood of login/logout causing weird teleportation paths way off-screen and stuff

2024-03-30:	refactored a pissload of code so that all the main reading/writing heatmap data stuff is inside HeatmapNew and HeatmapImage (and not WorldHeatmapPlugin) so that they can be tested /debugged/profiled with some standalone test program rather than only being able to be run in runelite.

** UPDATE RELEASED **

2024-04-01:	Updated map to include Varlamore

2024-04-03:	NOTE: I wonder if it's possible to just use runelite's MapImageDumper directly from the plugin instead of using my HeatmapImage class, so that the world map is always up to date? Perhaps I can override its methods or something to add the heatmap visualization.
	result: Just remembered that MapImageDumper uses a somewhat broken version of BigBufferedImage which creates big ass temp files that never get deleted, so it shouldn't be used in a plugin.

2024-04-03:	Changed default speed-memory tradeoff from 4 to 6

2024-12-07: Changed default heatmap alpha from 0.65 to 1.0

2024-12-07: Added int field to HeatmapNew: AccountType

2024-12-07: Added int field to HeatmapNew: CurrentCombatLevel

2024-12-07: Changed image output filenames for better sorting (now the name comes before the date)

2024-12-09: Made it periodically upload files to https://www.osrsworldheatmap.com/api/upload-csv/

2024-12-10: Added opt in/out checkbox for uploading anonymous data to contribute to the global heatmap

2024-12-10: Changed PLACES_SPOKEN_AT to include other people talking instead of just the user, because one user usually doesn't talk too much. It would be more interesting to see a heatmap of where people talk in general.

2024-12-10: Fixed some buttons not fitting their text

** UPDATE RELEASED **

2024-12-11: Added heatmap age to panel tooltips

2024-12-11: Added Tile Count labels to panel

2024-12-11: Added option for blue world map for heatmap images

2024-12-19: Made the heatmap data uploading turned off by default

2024-12-24: Started using injected OkHTTPClient & stopped doing upload on main thread

2024-12-24: Moved backup & autosave routines out of main thread, onto ScheduledExecutorService

** UPDATE RELEASED **

2025-01-01: Added icon to plugin

** UPDATE RELEASED **

2025-01-05: Refactored startup/shutdown code to be simpler and also prepare for seasonal world support

2025-01-05: Made retroactive half-fix for heatmaps contaminated with leagues data

2025-01-06: Fixed how a non-heatmaps file starting with a yyyy-mm-dd in the .heatmaps folder could cause a crash

2025-01-06: Added the rolling-back of normal heatmaps (instead of just deleting them) to the half-fix mentioned above

2025-01-06: Started using LocalDateTime instead of Date because apparently Date is horrible and deprecated

2025-01-06: Fixed new bug where startUp() would cause a crash if run mid-game instead of on runelite startup, due to
	startUp() -> loadHeatmaps() being run before event listeners that set necessary metadata such as onPlayerChanged()

2025-01-07: Made HeatmapNew.readHeatmapsFromFile() parse the fields dictionary-style instead of via direct indexing

2025-01-07: Started using a field String "seasonalType" instead of a boolean "isSeasonal" to determine if a heatmap is seasonal or not,
	in addition to encoding the type of the seasonal world.	That way, we can automatically differentiate Leagues V
	from Leagues VI, etc., so long as the "Activity" attribute of seasonal worlds continue to be parseable,
	e.g. "Leagues V" -> "Leagues V", "Leagues V - Sorceress' Garden" -> "Leagues V". Dat means different future seasonal
	gamemodes will now be automatically kept separate

2025-01-07: Fixed how uploads would be triggered by clearing a heatmap

2025-01-07: Fixed heatmap-clearing backup procedure

----You are Here----

TODO: Introduce a fix for the naming scheme of heatmap files. Aka, how they're named after the date that they were
	started rather than the date they were last updated, which is kinda confusing. Once you do this,
	adjust the leagues incident note because it gives instructions according to the bad naming scheme

TODO: isSeasonal isn't yet included in the heatmap serialization, so currently only heatmaps that went through
	the contamination detection process are marked as seasonal in memory, and then writing them to disk and
	reading them again results in them having an isSeasonal = false status, which causes them to be written
	to the wrong images folder, probably among other tings.
	Whilst fixing this, see if there's a more robust, dictionary-like way to read the metadata of heatmap files
	instead of indexing them by their expected order in the CSV

TODO: Remove the fields maxVal, minVal, numTilesVisited etc from the heatmap serialization/deserialization process. They shant have been there in the foist place.

TODO: When you hop from a normal world to a seasonal world, the jump in location is counted as a teleport, meaning we need to reinitialize all the relevant variables such as lastX, lastY, and probably the skillXp hashmap

TODO: Determine when to upload heatmaps by the age of the *oldest* heatmap, rather than doing them all individually. This will result in other heatmaps being uploaded even though they may be no different than the previous time they were uploaded, but it allows us to make the uploading rate limit more strict.

TODO: check out how LootManager sent their in-game update message to the chatbox in all red	text

TODO: Remove any temporary log.debugs()

** UPDATE TO BE RELEASED **

TODO: LOOT_VALUE is kinda useless because it's dependent on both the amount of loot dropped by each NPCs, and the frequency at which people kill them.
	Not sure if it's possible, but an AVERAGE_LOOT_VALUE would be much more informative. However, I suppose that would be information that is already available on the wiki.

TODO: Update world map image

TODO: Large: Start tracking heatmaps in 3 dimensions? Would have to convert existing heatmaps, and the existing data would be mucked.

TODO: Make it so that the button that opens the website includes some user-agent/referrer deets about where the user was referred from (the plugin)

TODO: Add PLAYERS_KILLED (might want to separate normal vs. deadman or something)

TODO: Make HeatmapNew.estimateSize not a static method

TODO: Make an auto-image button for each heatmap type instead of only having the option for both Type A and Type B

TODO: See if there's any reason why that guy's heatmaps were resetting
    NOTE: Maybe I should see if there's anything interesting about the time since his last save file when it reset

TODO stretch goal: Have the heatmaps displayable in the in-game world map similarly to how Shortest Path displays them.
