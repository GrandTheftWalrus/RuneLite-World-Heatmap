# RuneLite World Heatmap plugin
This plugin logs each tile that the local player steps on to create a visualization of where they most often travel.  Currently, the value of the tile that the local player is standing on is incremented *each time it is stepped on*. Soon, there will also be the option of incrementing the current tile being stood on *each game tick*, meaning that standing in the same place for a long time will continuously increase that tile's value. The former option will create a heatmap better suited for visualizing the paths taken, whilst the latter will visualize where the most time is spent.
